TM::Apeform Change Log

2004-04-30
    * Support for units added. Call $form->text("Label", "Help\tUnit") for
      example. The units value is displayed behind the element.
    * Added two examples adopted from PEAR::HTML_QuickForm.
    * Added another nice CSS-only example to example_templates.php.
    * test.php is back (uses PEAR::PHPUnit now).

2004-04-18
    * In template 'input' the tag {error} is optional now. If omited, an error
      message will replace the label (as previous versions of the class did). If
      present, an error message will NOT replace the label. WARNING! This change
      is incompatible to previous versions of the class!
    * New elements: header() (Thanks to Shimrod!) and staticText() (similar to
      text, but not editable). New template for header added.
    * Added posibility to specify an id for the form using Apeform(0, 0, "id").
      Now two or more forms in one page are possible. (Thanks to René Pönitz!)
      See example_multiform.php.
    * Auto-focus is disabled by default if the form gets a non-default id. Set
      setFocus to true to enable it.
    * Submit button always get accesskey="s" if only one button is defined.
    * Multiple calls of toHtml() failed. Fixed.
    * Changed element id's from "element3l" to "element3i".
    * The default templates <br> wasn't XHTML compatible. Changed to <br />.

    * Tiny speed-ups (count() moved out of for()).

2004-01-10
    * The file upload triggers an user warning if "safe mode" restrictions are
      in effect and tmpDir is not set properly. The garbage collection does not
      crash any more.
    * Handling of special "umlaut" characters improved in _getUnixName().
    * In action="...", any "&" becomes "&amp;" according to the W3C.
    * A bunch of code beautyfications.

2003-12-28

2003-11-17
    * Added getName(). (Thanks to Shimrod!)
    * In toHtml(), replaced PHP_SELF with PHP_SELF?QUERY_STRING. (Thanks to
      Shimrod!) REQUEST_URI doesn't work on non-Apache servers.
    * In _getFocusHandler(), replaced forms[0] with forms['form']. (Thanks to
      Shimrod!)
    * In file(), removed the environment stuff. tempnam() handles this. (Was a
      bug caused by a bug in realpath(). It never returns false.)
    * file() displays at least first 12 characters of the filename submitted.
    * _doGarbageCollection() introduced.
    * Improved the example_advertisement.php example.

      variables if tmpDir does not exists.

2003-10-23
    * Introduced _magicQuotes, use Apeform(..., ..., false) to disable.

      any {help} from your HTML templates if you want.

      the directory using $form->tmpDir or leav it empty to use default /tmp.

    * Bugfix: Unchecking a via $defaultValue checked checkbox won't cause a
      ping-pong loop any more. Still critical but works in most cases.
